# Basic Sample Hardhat Project & JSON_RCP Practice

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

## Set Up Hardhat Project Structure

This is a generic setup document, so please make sure to name your Hardhat project to the project you are currently working on!

1. In a folder of your choice, run mkdir [NAME OF YOUR HARDHAT PROJECT]
2. cd into that project
3. Run npm init -y
4. Run npm install dotenv
5. Run npm install --save-dev hardhat
6. Run npx hardhat
7. Select 'Create a basic sample project'
8. You will then get a few more options such as if you want to create a .gitignore
9. Go ahead and delete the sample-script.js in the /scripts directory - not the directory itself
